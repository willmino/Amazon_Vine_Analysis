I work at a company.

I work with Jennifer.

We have a client named SellBy.

Our next project is analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.

Amazon Vine Program is service allowing manufacturers and publishes to receive reviews for their products.

Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members. The members are required to publish a review.

For this challenge, analyze 50 datasets.

Each dataset has reviews of specific product.

Pick ONE of the datasets:

1. PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset
2. Transform the data
3. Connect to an AWS RDS instance
4. Load the transformed data into pgAdmin

5. Use either PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

6. Write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
